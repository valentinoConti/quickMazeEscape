## Quick-Maze Escape Game ##

Maze game developed with HTML5 and the ReactJS library, nothing else.

This development was born because of a challenge for the Making Sense company. It was developed on only two days, using React functional components with hooks, without using any Class component.

It has a 90%+ coverage of unit tests made with Jest and Enzyme packages, and it has a html coverage report on the coverage folder.

It's hosted on a github page [available to play here](https://valentinoconti.github.io/quickMazeEscape/). Enjoy!
